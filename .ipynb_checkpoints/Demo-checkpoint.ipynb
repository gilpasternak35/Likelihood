    "### A Quick Rundown:\n",
    "\n",
    "Likelihood is a data quality monitoring engine that measures the surprise, or entropy, of members of a given dataset. To learn more about the basic theory behind it, one may click on the 2 links below:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "http://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic essence is: uncertainty is maximized (it is most regular) in cases where the probability structure of a dataset is chaotic, meaning we don't have much information about it. However, when we can identify some given patterns about the probability structure of a dataset, we know that data members following these rules are not particularly chaotic. They are structured, and thus unsurprising. It is when these patterns are defied that the entropy shoots up to irregular heights. It is this percise rule defying approach that Likelihood uses to find outliers within a structured dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likelihood began as a numerical-estimation focused tool, but currently it works quite well with numerical, categorical, and timestamp data. Its functional approaches are mapped out below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrapping** - Building a distribution using the properties of a bootstrap, this approach uses the bootstrap to capture standard counts for values by TimeStamp and finds anomaly if test-set counts are a certain level off expected training set ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Series** - Using Facebook Prophet, Time Series evaluation puts surprising event in the context of the time in which they happened. Building a pattern off these approximations and understanding, the Time Series tool predicts the future for the test-set and raises an issue if expected future counts fall off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Kernel Density** - Smoothing a distribution so that certain properties can be utilized, Kernel Density fits the data under a curve depending on the data's variation and approximates which values in a distribution are unlikely by virtue of magnitude, thus finding the most surprising Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **PCA** - Using Dimensionality Reduction, PCA attributes the variation in the data to several significant columns which are used to compute bias row-wise. This approach is combined with the column based kernel density approach to truly triangulate the percise location of numeric data-error, and PCA's surprise metric is thus grouped with Kernel Density's.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relative Entropy Model for Categorical Data** - Much in the spirit of grammar, this relative entropy its own rules (expected formatting and behavior) for data, and obtains surprise based off the strictness of the rule that the data defies (defying a stricter rule would inherently be more chaotic)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **TimeStamp Intervals** - This Kernel Density approach computes similarly to the numerical Kernel Density, but this time orders the time intervals in the dataset and procceeds to test if there is a weird interval in which no data/ too much data was recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **In Progress**: Mutual Entropy for Mixed Numeric and Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, Likelihood should become a functional tool that can build functional distributions without the need for any context. Currently it functions more as a copilot"
