## To Do: ##

1. Add a "data spellcheck" to check categorical data that has defied metadata for specific issues 
2. Check for extraneous HTML tags laying around in the data
3. Make program more adaptable to more difficult data, particularly data with no clear index
4. Split Jupyter notebook into .py files, demo, and R&D
5. Create a better approach for checking the surprise factor of an NaN value
6. Improve documentation
7. Likelihood currently operates as batch job, though it could be significantly more useful if it utilized streaming
