Potential To do List:
1) Bootstrapping for counts of metrics
2)Change bootstrap to days
2)outliers in correlation between categories
3)Find indicators that potentially explain higher surprise factors:news?
4)PCA/ other anomaly detection
5)Talk to GE
6)Kernel Density to fix value outliers
7)Generate more specific report indicating specific problematic areas of data/ data points?
8)Ergodic Data might be bad assumption
9)Delayed Data
10)Throw out warning if too small a sample size
11)Assess Surprise Metric: point out problematic areas of data in different colors? Like a weather map
